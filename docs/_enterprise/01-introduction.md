## Personal development

This component is an opportunity for personal development.

- Identify and respond to others' needs, thus building upon their networking
  and negotiation skills.
- Build trust and develop effective relationships with others both in and
  outside of the team.
- Work with/connect with external bodies, groups or stakeholders in order to
  develop their networking, negotiating and relationship building skills.
- Develop awareness of recognising value in ideas.
- Think speculatively, employing both convergent and divergent approaches to
  arriving at a solution.
- Develop and produce multiple solutions to identified problems through
  evaluation and analysis.
- Review and evaluate multiple solutions in contexts that anticipate change and
  contain elements of ambiguity, uncertainty or risk.
- Recognise that generating innovative solutions can sometimes be more
  meaningful and useful than the final outcome itself.

## Tools

I suggest you consider using some of the following tools for your workflow:

# Messaging system

These allow for quick exchange of information. There are various solutions
available:

- WhatsApp, Messenger, Snapchat: familiarity however not all are portable or
  support productivity tools.
- [Slack](https://slack.com/is), [gitter](https://gitter.im): popular in the
  workplace and good support for integration with other tools.

# Issue tracker (to do list)

Having a cloud based issue/task tracker is common practice. There are a number
of these available:

- [Trello](https://trello.com/): simple user interface and a lot of
  functionality.
- [Github](https://github.com/): this is very specific to software projects and
  is connected to using a software tool called "git".

# Version control

With your code some of you might want to learn version control: this is a tool
to handle different versions of files and merge them for you. One of the most
popular version control tools is called [git](https://git-scm.com/).
