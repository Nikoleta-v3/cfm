## Testing

When writing software that is to be used you should include tests.

Python has two tools for this:

- [The unittest library](https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html)
- [The doctest library](https://docs.python.org/2/library/doctest.html)

The first can be used to test code, the second to test documentation of code.
