# Installation

Everyone who came to the labs has been able to get a working version of
Python/Jupyter working: **if you have not: come and see me!**

**You are welcome to use the computer labs at any time.**

On a University machine you are unable to install software, there is however a
number of applications that you **can** install from the network. To do so,
click on `CardiffApps > School Applications > Maths > Anaconda ...`. **There is
a problem with this at the moment and it won't work.** 

# Jupyter notebooks

Python is a language that can be executed in multiple ways:

- The "Python shell";
- The "Ipython shell";
- Jupyter notebooks

We are going to use notebooks in this class. They are a versatile tool for not
only using Python but also communicating.

You can write
[markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) in
them.

You can export them to multiple formats: html, markdown, python files etc.

**Note that these are not running on the internet.**

# Working on this course

> A lot of things to learn: how will I remember it all?

This is a completely normal concern. I recommend treating this course just like
any other course:

- Take notes;
- Revise;
- **Retrieve**.

Remember that programming is just translating ideas in to
simple/fundamental/basic instructions.

You should watch and listen to the videos. These are there to help and offer an
initial explanation of the work. They are the equivalent of the lecture.

Some students have been confused by the `>>>` on the lab sheets which do not
appear in the videos. In the lab sheets and handouts, is important these are
just there so that you can see the difference between the input and outputs.
When you type the code you do not need to type the `>>>`.

Some of you might show me code on the chat channel. To make it easier to
read try and surround it in between 3 ticks: ` (the chat uses markdown).

# What you should do next:

- Start working on the rest of the first lab sheet.
- Start building up your notes.
- Perhaps create a study group with 3 or 4 of your peers.
