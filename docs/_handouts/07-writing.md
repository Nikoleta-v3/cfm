# What was in this lab sheet

- The basics of LaTeX

# How to include code in LaTeX

There are a number of ways to include code in LaTeX, one of the nicest ways is
to use the `minted` package. See the example coursework for how this is done.

# Floating figures in LaTeX

When using floats (for figures and tables) sometimes they are not in the
specified position in the final pdf. This is a blog post I wrote a while ago
explaining why and what to do about it:

# What is plagiarism

Here is a short video explanation about plagiarism:

# Good writing guidelines

There are many guidelines and important considerations to take in to account
when writing mathematics. Here is a good short summary:
https://zdaugherty.ccnysites.cuny.edu/teaching/Su-Guidelines_for_Good_Mathematical_Writing.pdf

Some specific points:

- Know your audience;
- Nudge your reader ``with gentle commands'';
- Writing well does not necessarily mean writing more;
- Give a roadmap for long arguments (help your reader);
- Use sentences;
- Use words;
- Use paragraphs;
- Use examples;
- Simplify and refine: until you submit it, it is a draft;
- Don't follow the guidelines when it's appropriate not to.
