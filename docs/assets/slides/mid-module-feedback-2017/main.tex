        I don't think its necessary that when someone enters the room late the
        entire lecture is stopped to wait for that person

        In lectures if no one answers a question after 30 seconds stop waiting
        :p

        Don't like calling on people to answer questions because not everyone
        is comfortabl and confident enough to do so.

        Your lectures are useful. They are well explained on what I find
        difficult.

    \begin{quote}
        Would prefer if we could go over the harder end questions in lectures,
        maybe start at the last question and work towards the first.

        Lab sessions are sometimes unnecessary when you haven't completed the
        work.
    \end{quote}

    \begin{quote}
        Lab sessions are very helpful for when you have a problem with the code
        or are stuck on the lab sheet.

        ``Only get help in lab session if indicated, maybe have PhD students go
        around class, interacting more.''

        Help on how to solve problems such as the harder lab sheet questions

        Less lectures and more labs to actually get feedback as opposed to
        just watching.

        Additional (optional) lab sessions would be good

        Very difficult to catch up if you don't understand something earlier
        which is used later.

    % clearer. However that this is the case with all subjects.

        I sometimes find it difficult to interpret how a function or library
        is supposed to work and how to use it properly when learning about them
        through online research. I get why its useful to do the research and how
        that could develop our skills but it might help people if there was a
        demo in the solutions (or something).

    % This comment puzzled me: I plan to discuss it in class and attempt to
    % clarify, perhaps my suggested highlighting will make things clearer.
